Printing data from remote page in JSON format

To create JAR file you need to import org.json. Tested under Eclipse and JRE 1.8.

It allows do get data from URL (secured with token) and print it using any printer installed in operating system. Ut allows to choose font family and size.

You can get the code and modify as you need to your purposes. We use it with our system for food ordering (details at https://itstart.eu/strony-www-z-systemem-zamawiania-jedzenia-online-dla-restauracji/ ) but it is suitable for any printing from JSON data after small modifications.
